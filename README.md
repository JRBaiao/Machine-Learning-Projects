# Machine-Learning-Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! ðŸš€ This folder contains a collection of projects exploring fundamental machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each project is structured with clear code implementations, explanations, and insights gained from the models.

Covered Topics:
Linear Regression: Predicting continuous values and understanding relationships between variables.

Logistic Regression: Binary classification and decision boundary analysis.

K-Means Clustering: Unsupervised learning for pattern discovery and segmentation.

Random Forest: Ensemble learning for robust classification and regression.

Each project includes datasets, preprocessing steps, model implementation, evaluation metrics, and visualizations to enhance understanding. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute! ðŸ˜Š
